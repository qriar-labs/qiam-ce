# General Features

The following items are key features available in QIAM:

## Single Sign-On (SSO)
QIAM provides SSO capabilities across multiple applications. Powered by OAuth2, we provide centralized user authentication that meets authentication and authorization standards.

## Identity Broker and Social Login
We support identity brokering and social login integration for external identity providers, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github, or any OpenID/OAuth2 ID provider. Local authenticators for citizens, such as Gov.br (Brazil), are also supported in the public sector.

## User Federation
QIAM integrates with external databases, such as LDAP and Active Directory, to sync users and groups from external sources. It also supports new user repository extensions. 

## Client Adapters 
We provide adapters for various platforms, including JavaScript, Node.js, Java EE, and Spring. QIAM also features native integration and support for Next.js, React.js, Vue.js, and general single page application frameworks and libraries. For your convenience, we provide examples and application blueprints demonstrating how to use QIAM auth providers.

## Standard Protocols 
QIAM supports OAuth 2.0, OpenId Connect, and SAML 2.0 protocols, as well as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), and JSON Web Signature (JWS).
